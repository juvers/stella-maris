            <p className="mb-3"> “If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.”
            (John Dewey, Democracy and Education, New York: Macmillian, 1944, p.167)
            The aim of educating a child is to prepare her to be relevant in ‘her’ future. The future of today’s child is the mid 21st century. For the child to fully take charge then, she should be taught in innovative and creative ways and not how her teacher was taught. Students should be taught bearing in mind where the world is moving economically, socially and technologically. This is the only way they can successfully gain employment after graduating from school.</p>

            <p className="mb-3">Stella Maris Girls College (SMGC) is a new secondary school (full boarding) for girls, owned by the Catholic Diocese of Uromi and managed by the Sisters of St Louis. The school is situated in a peaceful and serene neighborhood of Esan land in Edo State. With its enthusiastic and highly motivated staff, the school provides a well-balanced, and sound education for girls. </p>

            <p className="mb-3">The Catholic Diocese of Uromi is committed to “further the Church’s mission of evangelization, taking into cognizance the importance of ‘catching them young’ and training children in the way they should go for their benefit, those of their parents and of the society at large”. (Culled from The Educational Policy and Operational Handbook for the Catholic Diocese of Uromi). The establishment of SMGC was motivated by the long tradition of the diocese, of empowering children with quality education for productivity, sustainability, competitiveness, and self-actualization.</p>

            <li>All people of whatever race, condition or age, in virtue of their dignity as human persons, have an unalienable right to education.</li>
            <li>This education should be suitable to the particular destiny of the individuals, adapted to their ability, sex, and national cultural traditions.</li>
            <li>At the same time, this education should pave the way to brotherly (sisterly) association with other peoples, so that genuine peace and unity on earth may be promoted.</li>
            <li>True education aims to give people a formation, which is directed towards their final end – and simultaneously towards the good of those societies to which they belong and in which, as adults, they will have their share of duties to perform.</li>
            <li>As a consequence, with the help of advances in psychology and in the art and science of teaching, children and young people should be helped to develop harmoniously their physical, moral and intellectual endowments.</li>
            <li>Surmounting hardships with a gallant and steady heart, they should be helped to acquire gradually, and through constant effort, a more mature sense of responsibility towards the proper development of their own lives, and towards pursuing authentic freedom.</li>

        <h3>THE SISTERS OF ST LOUIS AND EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG</h3>
        <p>The Sisters of St Louis have a long-standing history of educating. We have been involved in education for the past 180 years in some parts of Europe, America and West Africa.   All Sisters of St. Louis wherever we are involved in education are imbued with the vision of our founder, Abbé Louis Bautain, of a world healed, unified and transformed by the saving wisdom of Christianity.  As St Louis educators we are called to teach all that is true and all that is good, all that needs to render human beings more enlightened and better. In the words of Abbé Louis Bautain, the Sisters of St. Louis are charged to “Give an education that is at once solid and wide in scope, enabling the students to see as one whole all that concerns human kind, all the wonders of the natural world...... educated in this way, the students will be led to an understanding of the heart of things”.</p>

        <p>Abbé Louis Bautain, the founder of the Sisters of St. Louis was born and went to school in Paris, France, in a very troubled time.  The trauma of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars surrounded his early years.  Louis was a very bright and hardworking student and at twenty years of age he became a professor of philosophy at the Royal College of the University of Strasbourg.  He loved his work, he yearned to share his search for the meaning of life; “Why am I here, Where did I come from, What is my destiny?”  Reason which seemed to him to be the truest guide did not satisfactorily answer these questions.  He found that students were searching for something more concrete than the romantic idealism and egoistical materialism that was the philosophy of that time.  With youthful enthusiasm he set out to discover TRUTH, i.e. the meaning of existence.  He had the reputation of being the best lecturer in the university.  He worked and studied with passionate intensity in continuing his search for truth.  A university colleague said, “Nothing was inaccessible or difficult to the mind of Bautain, his intelligence climbed all heights, shone in all spheres and was everywhere at home”.  He had a triple university doctorate, in medicine, literature and theology, and he was also an expert, because of his writings, in philosophy and law.  Yet, he was a very simple and warm hearted man.</p>

        <p>Like our founder, the Sisters of St Louis’ view of teaching is that it should present challenges to the young and allow them to challenge the situation of the world, so that they may be interested in creating a better world.  For us freedom is freedom to choose, freedom for responsibility.  Speaking and living are the two greatest ways of communication of the Truth that we live by.  We need to think well in order to speak well, and everyone should give time and effort to speaking well and being able to discuss and debate.  ‘We will have made progress if we succeed in giving our pupils a taste for serious study and if we encourage them to have wide interests which will enable them to see things as a whole, the interests of humankind, all parts of the world and the wonderful world of Nature.  This will widen their horizons, raise them above themselves and interest them in all that is human, because they themselves are human’ (Louis Bautain, Prizegiving Day, Institute de la Toussaint, Headmaster’s Report, 1837).</p>

        <h3>REFLECTIONS OF PAST STUDENTS OF ST. LOUIS SCHOOLS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THEIR SCHOOL DAYS</h3>

        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "circle" }}>
          <li>We were brought up to love one another.  In general, the St. Louis ‘charisma’ was an ‘agape’, a living experience of love in togetherness, unity and sharing.</li>
          <li>In St. Louis we were not only taught classroom subjects.  We were also educated on how to become respectable young ladies with good manners.  They taught me so much manners and virtues – apart from academics! Both the Rev. Sisters and the staff were determined to produce well-groomed ladies.</li>
          <li>I cherish the etiquette.  Socially we had a thorough education on etiquette.  We were taught how to carry ourselves with good deportment – how to walk smartly; how to sit modestly and with poise; how to react and behave appropriately in public; how to conduct ourselves generally with decorum everywhere – like educated ladies.</li>
          <li>We were taught how to talk and communicate politely, how to read/speak clearly with emphasis on good enunciation, pronunciations, punctuation and phrasing.  All St. Louis girls of our time were ‘well spoken’.
</li>
          <li>We were taught to be lady-like and how to interact with people from different tribes, religious and economic backgrounds.  We were taught how to live peacefully.</li>
        </ul>
