          <h3>Admissions Process</h3>
          <p className="text-justify">
            The process of admitting candidates into Stella Maris Girls College
            is divided into two phases. The first phase is a written examination
            in Mathematics, English Language and Aptitude test. The second phase
            is a face-to-face interview of the prospective students and their
            parents with the principal. This admission process starts with the
            purchase of forms from the form centers listed through to the
            examination day which is <strong>25th March 2023</strong>.

        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In SMGC, a new intake into JS1 must have turned ten (10) by September
          of the year of entry into the school. A student in the boarding house
          must be mature enough to take good care of herself, carry out the
          normal daily routine, and still be able to face her studies squarely.
          Also, this age limitation is to ensure that the girls are at least 16
          years old when leaving the school. We hope parents would understand
          this stance of the school and co-operate with us to produce mature
          ladies for the next phase of their lives.{" "}
