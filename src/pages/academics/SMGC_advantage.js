                            <h4>Stella Maris Learning Resource Centre (SMLRC)</h4>
                            <p> To ensure equity and inclusion where every student is valued and has the opportunity to be successful, the school has a center (SMLRC) which is an avenue to close the achievement gap for students with special needs. Teachers and students serve as volunteer tutors after school hours to provide extended learning to those who need more personalized and differentiated learning.</p>
                            <h4>Open Day</h4>
                            <p>
                                A day set aside every term when parents come to school and get feedback on their children from all the teachers. This is an excellent way of parents not just monitoring academic progress but also moral and well-being of their children through one-on-one interaction with the teachers and school management.</p>
